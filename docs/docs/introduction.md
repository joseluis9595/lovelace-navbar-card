Navbar Card is a custom Lovelace card designed to **simplify navigation** within your Home Assistant dashboard, heavily inspired by the great work of [**Adaptive Mushroom**](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/adaptive-mushroom/640308) and [**Google's Material Design**](https://m3.material.io/). It provides a sleek, responsive navigation bar that displays as a full-width bar at the bottom on mobile devices. On desktop, it adapts into a flexible container that can be positioned on any side of the screen (top, bottom, left, or right) adjusting its orientation to fit seamlessly.
